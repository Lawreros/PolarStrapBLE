Code adapted from the Microsoft C# sample Bluetooth Low Energy Program:
https://github.com/microsoft/Windows-universal-samples/tree/master/Samples/BluetoothLE

Main changes done to the program take place in Scenario2_Client.xaml.cs, where addition features not applicible to the H10 Polar Strap were
removed. The program was also changed to record both the RR-intervals and Heart Rate broadcasted from the Polar Strap, both displaying them
and writing them to a text file for further analysis.

Purpose:
Collect HR and RR-interval data on patients with ASD-3 unable to undergo normal ECG recording sessions.

Future Plans:
After affect is determined to be correlated with heart rate, real time analysis of incoming RR-interval data will be done. This will allow
for insight into affect changes in people who have difficulty expressing it.
